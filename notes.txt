%TYPE: It determines the type of data automatically. It's a means of declaring a variable and 
	assigning whatever the type of the table has. It'll hold whatever happens to be the type of the field.

%ROWTYPE: It's similar to the %type, but instead of one particular field, it references an entire row. The good thing
	is it's that if you have a table with a lot of different fields with different types, you could use this %ROWTYPE.

CURSORS:
  --Firstly, we declare the cursor.
 
  --Secondly, we declare the row type associated to the cursor
 
  --Then comes the BEGIN of our block, then we OPEN the cursor andthen FETCH, which is a statement that advances
 the cursor pointer to the next record

  --After each FETCH statement, the %FOUND and %NOTFOUND attributes must be tested.

  --IF the fetch statement results in a new row, execute any desired processing.

  --When completed, the cursor must be closed.
